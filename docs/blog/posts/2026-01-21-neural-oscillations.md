Neural oscillations are one of the most fundamental phenomena in computational neuroscience.

## Why are oscillations important?
They play a key role in coordinating neuronal activity across different brain regions.

### A mathematical example
$$
x(t) = A \sin(\omega t + \phi)
$$

where:

- $A$ is the oscillation amplitude  
- $\omega$ is the angular frequency  
- $\phi$ is the initial phase  

## Conclusion
In future posts, we will explore more detailed and biologically realistic models.
